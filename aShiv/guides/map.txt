CUSTOMIZE STYLE OF A LOADED LAYER

2. Click on the paintbrush icon to open the customizer panel.

3. Use the "Color", "Opacity" and "Line Weight" options to customize how you want the data layer geometry is displayed.

4. Make use of the options under the "Label" section to apply and customize how labels are displayed for each geometry of the layer.

5. From the options under "Advanced" section you can use "Clustering" and "Heatmap" options to manage data with point type geometry.

MANAGE MAP DATA LAYERS
----------------------

2. Use the two arrow icons to change the z-index (move layer one above or below another) of map layers.

3. Click on the trash bin icon to remove a layer from the display.

----------------------------------
EXECUTE SEARCH & FILTER OPERATIONS
----------------------------------

There are two levels of search that can be executed through the application. The Nomanitim based search can execute with or without a data layer being loaded. It searches for placenames from the nomanitim database over cloud to display a searched location.

1. Type any place name, in full or in part in the search box.

2. Select "Nomanitim" from the dropdown and click "Search"

3. If your text matches partially with any location/s in the Nomanitim database, they will be listed below the search section.

4. Select your choice and the map will zoom into the location with a marker placed on the exact coordinate.
 
The other level of search happens only when one or more data layers are loaded into the map. It looks for partial matches from all loaded layers and lists them for you to make your selection.
Just select "Loaded Data Layers" from the dropdown before clicking "Search"

5. Click "Clear" button to clear the panel of all the sorted options resulting from search operations.

--------------------
ROUTING & NAVIGATION
--------------------

The routing and navigation panel is also placed on the sidebar. You actually do not load any layers to execute routing and navigation. It all happens over cloud. Only the display and calculation happens at client level. It can run with layers on as well.

1. Right click on the map, preferably over a street, lane or highway to add the starting point. It should appear as a green round icon with a "S" in it.

2. Right click again at another part of the map again preferably over a street, lane or highway, to add the destination. It should appear as a red round icon with a "D".

3. Immediately the map draws the shortest route from "S" to "D". If there is an alternative route, it should draw another line between the points, although in a different color.

4. The navigation panel immediately displays the navigation details of the primary route (in blue). Clicking on the alternative route in orange color (if any) will change the navigation details of that route.

5. By default the speed is selected at 40kmph and the ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) is calculated according to the distance of the selected route. You can drag the speed slider to dynamically recalculate and display the ETA.

6. You can add interim points to redraw fresh routes involving the added points. To do that....

7. Place your mouse cursor above a drawn route.

8. While the cursor changes to a "pointer" style, left click, hold and drag the new "D" marker to another place on the map over a lane, street or highway and release the mouse.

9. A new route including the added point is recalculated and drawn. The navigation details also gets updated with fresh details.

10. Click "Click All Routes" button to clear the panel and map of all routing and navigation details.
